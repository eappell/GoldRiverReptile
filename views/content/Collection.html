                We started with one little Dumerils Boa named Dewey.  Through the years our collection has grown,
                and shrunk a little as we figured out which species we enjoyed working with, and some that we didn't.
                We are very proud that our collection represents exellent examples of the species, and are all very well
                cared for.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see from the collection below, we have focused primarily on Green Tree Pythons (Morelia viridis).
                Among the many beautiful localities of Green Tree Pythons, we have acquired excellent examples of the Arfak,
                Biak, and Jayapura locales, as well as outcrosses of those localities.  We have focused the majority of our
                collection on "designer" specimens exhibiting a high degree of yellow pigmentation into adulthood.  We have
                always tried to acquire animals from high quality, proven breeders, whose pedigree has been traced back
                to some of the earliest chondros brought into the US.  As a result, we have some spectacular adult chondros
                which we are honored to have the opportunity to work with.
            </p>
